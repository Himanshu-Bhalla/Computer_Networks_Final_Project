# Email Client
In this project we created an Email client using python and websockets. The additional feature added is that it can also send attachments.

# Steps to run the code
Before following the below steps download the full zip code from github. You can use any compiler but I have shown you the process using pycharm.

## Step1
Open the Pycharm and in the bottom right corner click on add interpreter and then a new window will open there click on new "Inherit global site-packages" and then give name to your virtual environment.
Initially we have given venv but in your machine u will have to add another.
Below are the images of both windows.
